# An Analysis of Bike-Sharing Data in New York City
## Overview
### Bike-sharing data from New York City in the month of August will be analyzed in order to gain an understanding of who is using the bikes, what they are used for, and how much demand there is overall for this service. This data will then be used to assess the viability of bringing this service to De Moines, Iowa.
## Results
The initial findings are very promising. Ridership is quite high with a majority of riders being subscribers. The data suggests that most riders use the service for their commutes to and from school and work.

Looking at peak hours of bike use in August, it becomes immediately apparent that bike use is highest during rush hour. This suggests that a significant number of riders are using the bikes to get to and from work and school.

![Trip Duration](https://github.com/NickBaldassarre/bikesharing/blob/9669ccf196f073442ec7ca70eb7cada3b2c7d9c6/Resources/trip_duration.png)

Bike trips are mostly quite short, with 5 min being the most common trip duration. This suggests that most riders are not travelling very far.

![Trip Duration by Gender](https://github.com/NickBaldassarre/bikesharing/blob/9669ccf196f073442ec7ca70eb7cada3b2c7d9c6/Resources/trip_duration_by_gender.png)

When separating by gender, it becomes clear that men use the service significantly more than women do. That being said, the trend for trip duration is similar for women and men and suggests that women and men have similar riding habits.

![Starting vs Ending Locations](https://github.com/NickBaldassarre/bikesharing/blob/9669ccf196f073442ec7ca70eb7cada3b2c7d9c6/Resources/starting_vs_ending_location.png)

As expected based on the trip duration data, the patterns of starting and ending locations are quite similar to one another. Most trips begin and end in the downtown core.

![Trips by Weekday Per Hour](https://github.com/NickBaldassarre/bikesharing/blob/9669ccf196f073442ec7ca70eb7cada3b2c7d9c6/Resources/trips_by_weekday_per_hour.png)

Organizing the data by weekday provides further insight, and shows that ridership during the week is busiest during rush hour, while on weekends it is busiest in the middle of the day.

![Trips by Gender Weekday Per Hour](https://github.com/NickBaldassarre/bikesharing/blob/9669ccf196f073442ec7ca70eb7cada3b2c7d9c6/Resources/trips_by_gender_weekday_per_hour.png)

Looking at this same weekday data separated by gender, there is further evidence that women and men have very similar patterns of using the service. Once again it is clear that men use the service significantly more than women, but the times of day that they use the service are similar.

![Customer vs Subscriber](https://github.com/NickBaldassarre/bikesharing/blob/9669ccf196f073442ec7ca70eb7cada3b2c7d9c6/Resources/customer_vs_subscriber.png)

Subscribers make up the majority of users of the service. They use the service primarily during the week, suggesting that they are using the service for their daily work or school commute. Customers on the other hand use the service most on weekends.

## Summary
The bike sharing program in New York City is a successful working model with a large and active subscriber base. With men being the most active users, and the busiest times being during rush hour, an initial marketing push should target men working in office buildings in downtown De Moines. Bike stations should be initially placed in the downtown core and immediately surrounding area. All efforts should be made to quickly build a subscriber base of commuters in the downtown core.

An additional visualization that would provide greater insight would be to compare gender to trip duration to see if there are differences in the riding habits of men and women. Another visualization that could be very helpful would be to compare trip duration between customers and subscribers. It could help to inform pricing for customers vs subscribers. With all of this data, a plan can be put in action to try to replicate this success in De Moines.
